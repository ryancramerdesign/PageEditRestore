# ProcessWire Page Edit Restore

**This module helps to prevent page edits in the admin from getting lost when 
the userâ€™s session is lost.** 

It prevents lost page edits in a couple of different ways. First, it pings the 
server in the background at regular intervals to prevent the session from 
timing out. But if the user still gets logged out (for whatever reason) it 
alerts them that they are no longer logged in, and gives them instructions 
on how to save their edits. When there are unsaved edits present, the page 
editor provides the ability to restore, preview, test or delete them.
